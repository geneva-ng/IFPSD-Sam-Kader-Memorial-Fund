# Sam-Kader-Memorial-Fund

Please note that the screenshots of the website included in this repository do not reflect the current state of the website. 
The administration of the site has been transferred to a new team, and they have made significant changes to the design and 
functionality that do not reflect my work or my style. The website showcased here is my original version, and while I am no longer 
involved in the administration of the website, I am proud of the work I contributed to the foundation and wanted the opportunity to 
showcase it to you. Thank you for your understanding, and enjoy!
